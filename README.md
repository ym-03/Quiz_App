# Quiz App 
This project is my first attempt at creating a quiz application as a beginner. 
The quiz app aims to provide an interactive and engaging experience for users to test their knowledge in general questions related to India and Tech-field.
The app allows users to select a quiz category, answer multiple-choice questions.
It also keeps track of the user's score and displays a message at the end of quiz.
As a beginner, I have strived to keep the code simple and well-structured, focusing on the core functionality of the app.
Thank you for trying out my quiz app!
